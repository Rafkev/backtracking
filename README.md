# backtracking
Backtracking algorithm implemented in JavaScript.
Backtracking is a technique used in algorithms to systematically search for solutions to a problem by trying different options, and if the current option does not lead to a solution, it backs up and tries a different option. This is often used in solving problems such as puzzles, constraint satisfaction problems, and combinatorial optimization.

Here a backtracking algorithm implemented in JavaScript. Let's use it to solve the N-Queens problem, which is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
